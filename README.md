# Lazymux

A tmux-sessionizer inspired TUI for managing tmux sessions for your projects.

Inspiration: 

- [Primeagen tmux sessionizer](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/tmux-sessionizer)
- [OpenTUI](https://github.com/sst/opentui) and [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/docs) two amazing projects that made me start this project, really amazing work.



# react

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This project was created using `bun create tui`. [create-tui](https://git.new/create-tui) is the easiest way to get started with OpenTUI.
